#### TGC: Building Great Sentences by Brooks Landon



#### Part 1: Sequences of Words

1. Style: tough style (push), sweet style and stuffy style. 

   

2. Words structure : Syntax (horizonal ) + Vocabulary (vertical)

   

3. long sentence: *it's not how long you make it. but how you make it long.*

   

4. *"Why should a sequence of words be anything but a pleasure?"* by Gertrude Stein

   

5. sequences of words , subjective + predicate , is a sentence. 

   

6. proposition: usually expressed in the form of sentence, is a statement about reality that can be accepted or rejected. eg. upper iceberg is Sentence, and down iceberg is Proposition.

   

7. Three Main Choices we make about sentences:

   - what to write about and what we want to accomplish writing about it

   - which words to use

   - what order we put them together: syntax - the way you put together the words you choose

     

8.  The sentences we write combine three kind of choices: 

   - the **propositions** we want to advance
   - the **vocabulary** we choose: Ladder of Abstraction ( abstract => precise)
   - the **syntax** or order in which we want our readers to experience our propositions
     - the same words in different order have different meanings = **style is content**

9. the way we say things may be as or more important than what we say.

#### Part 2: Grammar and Rhetoric

1. elegant and effective writing:

   - effective writing: writing that anticipates, shapes, and satisfies a reader's need for information
   - simple and direct  does not mean simplest and short!
   - elegant writing: elegant variation - the tendency of second-rate writers to concentrate more on "expressing themselves prettily" than on "conveying their meaning clearly"

2. Grammar: has to do with classifying words by their function in a sentence.

3. Rhetoric: unlike grammar, has to do with both motive and impact. 

   Grammar has to do with words, while rhetoric has to do with the way we do things with words.

4. Effectiveness and elegance in writing are both rhetorical issue, and grammar alone can lead us to neither. 

5. style: is what the writer writes and /or what the reader reads. 

#### Part 3: Proposition and Meaning

1. proposition: a statement about reality that can be accepted or rejected. Each proposition can be broken down further into propositions: 

   - there is something called an "I".
   - I am in the category of those somethings
   - There is a category of physical or emotional condition known as "being tired"
   - My physical or emotional condition falls into that category

2. The basic unit of writing sentences is the proposition, not the word or even a sequence of words.

3. sentences join together propositions: 

   - side by side: I like to read and I like to write.
   - subordinating one to another: I, who like to write, also like to read.
   - marking temporal or causal relationships: Because I like to write I like to read. After I enjoying reading something, I like to start writing. 

   #### Part 6: The Rhythm of Cumulative Syntax
   
   1. "The modifier is the essential part of any sentence ... In practice , therefore, the sentence proceeds from something the reader may be expected to know already toward whatever new thing we wish to tell him. We proceed by addition. " by John Erskine
   2. generative rhetoric: 
   3. 4 principles for understanding and writing cumulative sentences
      - composition is essentially a process of **addition**. 
      - the information we add to sentences in modifying phrases gives the sentence a direction of modification or a direction of **movement**.
      - cumulative sentences tend to develop by downshifting through increasing detailed or specific **levels of generality** or levels of abstraction. 
      - cumulative sentences add **texture** to the propositional content of a sentences. 
        - texture: density or variety
