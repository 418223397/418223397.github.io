2. `Money`is the media to transfer wealth. It belongs to social creditability or IOU. it is kind credit and debit to give what you did before in society. It is debating because someone steals IOU and government prints more IOU. It is a zero-sum game. Some join status game who cannot make a good performance in money game.
3. `status` is your rank in social hierarchy. It is a typical zero-sum game. When you pursue for status game, you are becoming an angry combating person. Status game means you try to be up in the ground of some being down.
