Liquid Staking Derivatives LSD (July 4 ,2022)

#### 1. Why PoW must be replaced by PoS

- to solve the problem of Ethereum: scalability, security, and sustainability by using Staking (incl. sharding)
- the Beacon Chain is a staking Chain to Ethereum. 
- After the mainnet merge with the Beacon Chain, the next step is Sharding, which is a multi-phrase upgrade to Ethereum's scalability and capacity. (shipping some time in 2023)
  - merge: transition of consensus : from proof of work to proof of staking
  - Layer 2: a team to solve the Ethereum Trilemma (decentralization, security, scalability)
  - rollup: the scalability upgrade solution which is Layer 2 project on Ethereum, just as the Lightning network on the top of  Bitcoin. 
    - rollup bundles of hundreds on transactions on Layer2 and posted on Layer 1
    - reduce gas fees
    - 2 different approaches to Rollup (difference between two is what data post on Layer1 & how data verified? )
      - optimistic:  run the computation on-chain, and when fault is suspected and must be checked. - **Fault Proofs**
      - zero knowledge (zk): run the computation off-chain and post a proof - **Validity Proofs**
- Sharding: a multi-phase upgrade to improve Ethereum scalability and capacity. (After the emerge)
  - scaling on Layer1
  - prefer zksnarks 

#### 2. How to be happened?

- Lido 
  -   PoS via the Beacon Chain since December 1st, 2020

- Beacon Chain
